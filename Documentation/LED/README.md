# LED

LED stands for **Light Emitting Diode**. It is a semiconductor device that emits light when electricity flows through it. Unlike traditional bulbs that use heat to create light, LEDs emit light directly from the movement of electrons.

## How LED Works
Inside an LED, there are two semiconductor layers — one with extra electrons (n-type) and one with fewer electrons (p-type). When current flows through the LED:

1. Electrons move across the junction.

2. As they move, they release energy.

3. This energy is emitted as visible light — a process called **electroluminescence**.

The color of the LED depends on the material used inside the diode.

## Components of an LED Light
- **LED Chip**: The light-emitting core.

- **Driver**: Converts AC power to low-voltage DC power.

- **Heat Sink**: Keeps the LED cool.

- **Lens or Cover**: Distributes light evenly.

These components ensure that LEDs last longer and work efficiently.
