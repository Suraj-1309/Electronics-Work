# Digital

In Arduino, Digital refers to signals or pins that can have only `two possible states`:
- **HIGH** (logic 1) -> usually **5V** (or 3.3V depending on board)
- **LOW** (logic 0) -> **0V**

## Digital Pins on Arduino
Digital pins on the Arduino are labeled `0–13` on common boards like Arduino UNO.
They can be used to:

-> Read digital input → (e.g., button pressed / not pressed)

-> Control digital output → (e.g., turn LED ON / OFF)

->  Generate PWM (on some pins marked with ~) to simulate analog output

## Functions 
1. [digitalRead()](digitalRead().md)
2. [digitalWrite()](digitalWrite().md)
3. [pinMode()](pinMode().md)
